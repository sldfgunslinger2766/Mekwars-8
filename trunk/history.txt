+ RFE: Peg factory purchase cost to original faction instead of current owner.
+ New MM Jar with SB and Munitions patch and TW rules.

+ BUG: Deds buffering all commands b/c they never have a CMainFrame. I'm dumb.
+ Better logging of startHost() failures when deds first sign on to servers.
+ RFE: Total BV's in /c modgame blocks, w/ finishing values for complete games.
R Client 0.1.44.7 / Server 0.1.44.7
+ BUG: Deds not forwarding DSD and USD commands to standard parseData().
+ BUG: Transferring a linked C3 Master could cause concurrent mod error.
R Client 0.1.44.6.
+ Changed place where saved mail request is issued, in the hope that it will
  fix the "PM Splash Crash" TT users are experiencing with Client 0.1.44.5.
R Client 0.1.44.5 / Server 0.1.44.6
+ Incoming data (as directed to MWClient.doParseDataInput) checked and stored
  if the main frame is null. Only data commands (USD, DSD) are allowed to
  proceed normally. Other commands are processed en block after CMainFrame is
  constructed. This stops NPE's, but makes the client open more slowly.
+ Moved main frame construction block in MWClient.java. Is now built after the
  chat connection opens and serverconfig.txt is fetched, to stop NPE's.
+ BUG: Infinite splash screen for any user who connects w/o a local copy of
  the campaignconfig.txt. Values from campaignconfig were being requested
  before a connection to the server was opened in order to fetch them, leading
  to a null MainFrame and unending splash.
+ BUG: Impossible for a new user to log into campaign. Server wasn't allowing
  /c getserverconfig to pass through and execute unless the issuing player was
  logged in by SignOn.java, making it impossible for an unenrolled user to get
  the campaignconfig.txt.
R Server 0.1.44.5
+ BUG: impossible to buy from worlds your faction controls.
R Client 0.1.44.4 / Server 0.1.44.4

+ RFE: Include duration of games in the resultsLog.
+ RFE: Show duration of games in /c modgames output.
+ RFE 1552224: Ability to not show players' names in Tick Reports. Two new
  options in ServerConfig's Faction tab. Uncheck to use faction names in place
  of player names in tick report, news feed entries, or both.
- Removed CUnit.getWeightclassName(). Dupe of Unit.getWeightClassDesc()
- Removed CUnit(CCampaign c) constructor. Unused.

  of the PS| & CPlayer.setData(String s) pair.
- Removed Army.hasMoreInfantryThanElse() & replaced some enums w/ iterators.
+ BUG: Mezzo ignored when requesting a unit. Feature and associated classes
  removed instead of being fixed, as no Server Op used or wants the feature.
+ BUG: Status icons where not showing a place for Repair/Maintenace
  when in !dynamic mode.
+ BUG: visibilty for ops was using its own variable to calculate itself
+ BUG: OpponentListHelper caused an inf loop of people that were active

  attribute in the For statment and adding to itself while in the for loop.

  opposite ends of the board like normal 2 player games.
+ BUG: FFA games where more then one person per house was in it would cause a
  null to be listed instead of the number of players.
+ BUG: game visibility was going below min visibilty, due to dusk and night 
  fights
+ Streamlined RequestCommand. Support for old-style MMNET SOL requests wasn't
  needed anymore. NOTE: There appears to be a bug in RequestCommand which leads
  to mezzo/pricemods being ignored. More changes to the file are forthcoming.
+ Added to code to move Server Campaign Config data so that it is transfered
  via the chat port vs data port. First step removing data port.
+ BUG: Engine repair not working in bulk dialog.
- Removed cheatlog.X. Entries duped in modlog.X, making cheatlog superfluous.
+ RFE: Show use of StripUnits and DeleteAccount in mod channel.
+ Replaced usages of Boolean.valueOf(String s).booleanValue() with Java 1.5's
  Boolean.parseBoolean(String s). More compact code, and less autoboxing.

  command may still fail on players with repairung units.
+ BUG: Opponent lists being built improperly after cancellation of games.
- Removed ShortValidator.genericAbleToDefend and OpponentListHelper.matches.

+ SHouse no longer defined as an abstract class.
- Removed SHouse.NORMALHOUSE, SHouse.MERCHOUSE, SHouse.NONCONQHOUSE and

+ BUG: Possible to defend AFR while vacant units are in armies.
R Client 0.1.41.1 / Server 0.1.41.3
- Removed support for eras. Unecessary code complication. Tables should be in
  /standard (factory production), /rare (BM production) and /reward (from RP)
  folders. Welfare.txt belongs in /standard.
+ Add warnings to errlog.0 when reading planets.xml that has TIMEZONE fields.
- Removed "ProductionTable" var from UnitFactory and subclasses. Unused MMNET
  remnant. After 2-3 widespread releases, should be able to re-use its token.

  a server after a crash.
